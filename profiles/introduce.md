# Introdution 

Hi I'm Viet,

I'm a Solution Architect who is expert on Microsoft Architecture, Domain Driven Architecture and Cloud Soltulion, include Cloud Native and AWS, I'm also ceritified by AWS Solution Architect Professtional certification. As a teamleader, I aslo have experience of managing a large team with 17 members, include 10 software engineers.
And actually, I'm a ex-employee of PRDCV, who looking forward to have a chance to come back.

# Why lelf on 2021?

In 2021, I've just compleled the Washing Machine project successfully, be promoted to APE2, I'm so happy at that moment.
But I know that I'm still lack of experience of managing a large team size, building a Microservice System from scratch and facing with customer directly to understand what they really need. Nashtech gives me the vision of what I need to do as a next step, and I cannot escape.

# What archived on Nashtech

After 4 years, I beleive that now I'm mature in both Technical and Management skill as a technical specialist.
I built 2 Micoservices for my customer, collaborate with our customer to develop and maintain the product continuously with full-lifecycle follow to Production roadtmap,
and to archive this work, I have a great team with 17 members, and I have responsibility to take care 10 software engineers, inprise them on both professional and persional growth. 

# Why want to comeback

- I believe that my next step is to become an Enterprise Architect who will have the vision of Organization software architecture.
- and I can see that PRDCV now is becoming a Panasonic Cloud Center, and having many challeges of providing Cloud Solution on Organization level.
- Now, I'm not only take about Technical only, to become an Enterprise Architect, I need to take care about Organization needs to have the vision to provide the solution.
- So, I believe PRDCV is the right place allow me develop my career on long-term in up coming time.

# Why to leave Nashtech

Actually, my projects in Nashtech is ended, Product goes to Production already, I archive so many experience in this projects, and my contact with Nashtech will become to the end also. This is the right time for my next step, and PRDCV is always the place I would like to contribute.
